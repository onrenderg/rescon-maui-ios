                            <p align="justify">● For selection of an individual building site, nature and behaviour of soil or rock (and dip and strike of discontinuity surfaces) should be assessed at the cuttings or test pits (450 mm x 450mm) at bottom and 1 to 2.m in depth or by auger boring (in soils).<br>
							●  Many rocks behave like clay or silt on wetting or on submergence, rock pieces should therefore be kept in water for 24 hours for assessing the effect of wetting.<br> 
							●  Hill sides with less than 30° slope in general are noted to be stable as the gradient correspond to safe angle of repose of slope forming material.<br> 
							●  The foundation of an individual building should be located away from the edge of the terraces formed as natural floodplain deposits or constructed by cutting and filling along the hill side or at the river bank. Such foundations should lie away from the line extending from the toe of the terrace or the river bank at an angle of 30°.<br>
							● Individual buildings should be so oriented that it is properly sunlit and it shall not be located on the bottom of the valleys or permanent shadow zones of ridges and peaks, and high wind zones.<br> 
							● Hillsides susceptible to landslides and erosion at toe due to probable meandering of the rivers and gullies should be avoided while locating buildings.<br> 
							● Hill sides having extensively folded, faulted, fractured and fissured rock strata should be avoided for location of buildings.</p>
