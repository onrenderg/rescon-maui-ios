                            <p align="justify">Construction inspection should identify the issues related to poor workmanship. Site work should be carried out with utmost care to avoid any compromise with the construction quality. This section provides the checklist/precautions/suggestions for carrying out foundation work, masonry work, formwork and casting of confining elements.</p>
							<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
							<p align="justify">● Foundation of a building is responsible for transfer of load to underneath ground. Small size of footing, inadequate depth, resting on poor/weak soil, waterlogged area etc. may result into cracks/ sinking of the building. Considering soil conditions at site, design of foundation should be adequate.<br>
							● Foundation on clayey soil is not preferred as it is observed that breakdown of soil structure takes place when load is applied on it which results in reduction of its strength<br>
							● Sand should consist of granular material, and it should be clean and free of mud or any other organic material such as roots.<br>
							● The excavation done at the construction site for foundation must be according to the design and must be properly leveled by ramming. Do not refill excavated soil back into the trenches to level it. Level it by Base concrete.<br>
							● Footings are continuous below all the masonry walls<br>
							● Width of strip footing below the walls is at least 750 mm for single storey house.<br>
							● Tie-columns start from footing simultaneously with foundation masonry .<br>
							● Spacers are provided below the column steel bars to achieve required cover below the tie-column reinforcement of RCC footing.<br>
							● Trenches  must be  clean and have even surface.</p>
							<p><strong>Masonry</strong></p>
							<p align="justify">●	Clean the work zone.<br>
							●	Wetting of the bricks prior to construction of walls.<br>
							●	The plumb level shall be checked at every course<br>
							●	Dead mortars are cleaned for new work and checked.<br>
							●	Racking and curing is ensured - all vertical joints and horizontal joints must be properly aligned.<br>
							●	Proper and accurate checking for pointing, plastering and finishing details.<br>
							●	Erection of frames-Alignment and position of the doorframes is checked.<br>
							●	Masonry Joints must be checked for uniformity and thickness not greater than 10 to 12mm is maintained.<br>
							●	Proportion of mortar mix should be checked.<br>
							●	Quality of water for mixing or curing should be clean. Check the mortar preparation and mix consistency<br>
							●	Proper filling of the joints with mortar should be ensured.<br>
							●	Ensure the brickwork height  height on a single day should not be more than 1200mm.<br>
							●	RCC and Masonry work is covered with wet jute bag after the end of every day.<br>
							●	The  water curing is to be ensured for at least 15 to 20 days.</p>

							<p><strong>Shuttering</strong></p>
							<p align="justify">● ﻿Formwork is used to cast building components in required shape and size. The formwork is designed and erected to remain sufficiently rigid and strong during placing and compaction of concrete, and shall be such as to prevent loss of slurry from the concrete.<br>
							●	Use hard and durable; water tight; weather resistant formwork and strong props, horizontal bracings and runners.<br>
							●	Remove rubbish, particularly, chippings, shavings and sawdust from the forms<br>
							●	Level the formwork and apply form releasing agent to formwork.<br>
							●	Ensure dimensions and levels of formwork.<br>
							●	Seal gaps at joints of board/plates using plastic tape.<br>
							●	Lay electrical conduits with reference to electrical drawing.<br>
							●●	Provide plastic pipe (75/100mm dia.) in slab to pass WC/drain pipe through slab as per Plumbing detail.</p>

							<img src="img/Figure.6.4.JPG" alt="CONFINED MASONRY" class="full-width-image"/>
							<p><strong>Confining Elements</strong></p>
							<p align="justify"> ●Reinforcement cages are rust free and raised on spacers.<br>
							● Dimensions of formwork are adequate.<br>
							● Ensure proper cover to the reinforcement.<br>
							● Compact the concrete using vibrator to avoid honeycombing. Over compaction/vibration<br>
							● should be avoided, to prevent bleeding and segregation<br>
							● Concrete mix is used within 30 minutes of mixing with water<br>
							● Do not spread or drop concrete from more than 1200 mm height.<br>
							● Deposit concrete as near as practicable to its final position, distributed in small quantities.</p>

							<img src="img/Table.6.1.JPG" alt="CONFINED MASONRY" class="full-width-image"/>
							<p><strong>Concreting</strong></p>
							<p align="justify">● Reinforcement cages must be rust free<br>
							●	Ensure proper cover to the reinforcement.<br>
							●	Provide clear cover to bars by providing spacers.<br>
							●	Ensure dimensions of formwork shall be as per drawings.<br>
							●	Extra water in concrete reduces strength,<br> 
							●	enhances rusting of bars , which can causes leakages and dampness.<br> 
							●	Compact the concrete using vibrator to avoid honeycombing.<br>
							●	Over compaction/vibration should be avoided, to check bleeding and segregation<br>
							●	Concrete mix is used within 30 minutes of mixing with water<br>
							●	Do not spread or drop concrete from more than 1200 mm height.<br>
							●	Place concrete as near as practicable to its final position. <br>
							●	Do not remove bottom shuttering of slabs and beams before 28 days, side shuttering can be removed earlier depending on weather and temperature. If temperature is below 10 deg allow  shuttering a few days extra.<br>
							●	Do not allow concrete to freeze in green stage or within 28 days of placing in formwork.</p>
