							<p><strong>8.1. Existing Plans and Improvisations</strong></p>
							
							
							
							
							<p align="justify">The next few pages contain the plans that were provided to CSIR – CBRI for improvisation. The following points illustrate the need of improvements that were done to the plans.<br>
							1. Enhanced Structural Integrity: Government buildings often need to be retrofitted to meet modern seismic codes, ensuring they can withstand earthquake forces. This involves reinforcing structural elements to prevent collapse.<br>
							2. Improved Daylighting: Increasing openings for daylighting not only reduces energy consumption but also enhances the safety of occupants by providing natural light in case of power outages during earthquakes.<br>
							3. Optimized Plinth Area: Adjusting the plinth area helps distribute the building's load more evenly, reducing the risk of structural failure during seismic events.<br>
							4. Adherence to Codal Provisions: Ensuring distances and sizes of structural components adhere to codal provisions improves the building’s resilience against earthquakes by following established safety standards.<br>
							5. Circulation Improvements: Fixing issues in circulation, such as ensuring clear routes, is critical for the safe and efficient movement of people during and after an earthquake.<br>
							6. Incorporating Confined Masonry: Using confined masonry in design enhances the ductility and strength of the building, making it more capable of absorbing and dissipating seismic energy.<br>
							7. Retrofitting for Load Path Continuity: Improvisations may include ensuring continuous load paths so that seismic forces are effectively transmitted through the building without causing localized failures.<br>
							8. Upgrading Non-Structural Elements: Enhancing the design of non-structural components, such as partition walls and ceilings, prevents them from causing injuries or blockages during an earthquake.<br>
							9. Foundation Strengthening: Reinforcing the building’s foundation helps in stabilizing the structure and preventing differential settlement or failure during seismic activity.<br>
							10. Use of Advanced Materials: Incorporating modern construction materials that are better suited to absorb and withstand seismic forces can significantly improve the earthquake resistance of government buildings.</p>
