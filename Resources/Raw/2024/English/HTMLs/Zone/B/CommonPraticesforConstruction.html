                                ● Draw a 4-meter line from A to B where a 90-degree angle is required. Fix pegs at A and B.<br />
                                ● The first person holds the initial end of the measuring tape with one hand on peg A at zero, and the other hand at 12 meters.<br />
                                ● The second person holds the tape at the 4-meter mark and fixes a peg at B and marks it at 4 meters.<br />
                                ● The third person holds the tape at 9 meters and marks it, which will be point C. Now place the peg at point C.<br />
                                ● Increase the line AC to any required length.<br />
                                ● Clean the construction site and ensure that it is flat.<br />
                                ● Place concrete block markers at all corners. The markers should be placed about 1.5 meters away from the outer walls of the proposed building.<br />
                                ● Blocks should be of equal height, and the thread should be kept off the ground.<br />
                                ● Mark the center line of the outer wall with cotton thread and tape. Stretch the cotton thread firmly so it does not sag.<br />
                                ● At the corners of the building, divide the cotton thread line at right angles to each other. Use the 3:4:5 method to obtain a 90-degree angle.

                            <p align="justify">
                                ● Use a water tube up to 10 meters in length and fill it with water.<br />
                                ● Hold both ends vertically so that water does not drain. Tap the filled tube with your finger to eliminate or remove any air bubbles.<br />
                                ● Hold both ends together and make sure that the water level in both ends is the same.<br />
                                ● Identify the reference point A, which is the level you want to move to another place B.<br />
                                ● Have your assistant stand at the reference level A mark.<br />
                                ● Place the other end of the tube near point B, where the level is to be transferred. Move the tube up and down to bring the water level in the pipe at A. Mark the level at the other end of the tube, point B.<br />
                                ● Now, A and B are at the same level.
