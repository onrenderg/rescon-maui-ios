                            <p><strong>The thickness of the walls depends upon the design. Where bricks are costly but stone is available, precast stone concrete blocks, hollow blocks, hammer-dressed stones, etc., are used as masonry units. Walls must be strong enough to bear the loads, check moisture, and resist fire and other natural vagaries. The masonry units must be joined using cement mortar. All walls must be designed to take extra loads coming due to natural hazards like earthquakes, cyclones, floods, fires, etc.</strong></p>

                                1. At the site, store bricks in stacks. On the day before using the bricks in masonry, spray a lot of water on the stacks to drench the stack well up to the core.<br />
                                2. Again spray water before taking the bricks out from the stack for use in masonry. Dry bricks give poor quality and low strength masonry.<br />
                                3. The bricks are generally laid in a pattern called English Bond. Wall thickness is equal to one length of the brick, which depends upon the type of brick being used.

                                ● The vertical bars at corners and junctions pass through the RCC bands and wall corners without any break to tie the house vertically and horizontally.<br />
                                ● At least after 36 hours (depending upon weather temperature) of providing the RCC band at plinth level, the masonry in superstructure can be started.<br />
                                ● Continue water curing of masonry and plinth band so that it does not dry up for at least 28 days.<br />
                                ● The masonry in superstructure can be in concrete blocks of at least 60kg/sq.cm strength.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Step 8: Masonry above Plinth Level using Concrete Blocks</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                ● Above the Plinth level, it is better not to use stone masonry. It is neither economical nor safe.<br />
                                ● Solid concrete blocks (size 300x200x150mm, weighing about 18 Kg) having a compressive strength of at least 60 kg/sq.cm. are a better option.<br />
                                ● Hollow concrete blocks of size 400 x 200 x 200 mm, having at least 50mm thick outer walls and at least two cross cavity walls of 40mm thickness, weighing at least 18 Kg each can be used in cement mortar in single floor buildings having sloping CGI sheet roofing.<br />
                                ● Closed cavity blocks are better as mortar does not fall into the cavities during masonry work.<br />
                                ● Do not use mortar leaner than 1:6 in masonry. Prefer using stronger mortar.<br />
                                ● When using solid concrete blocks, special blocks with a slot are required to allow the vertical steel bars at corners to pass through.<br />
                                ● The central holdfast of the door frames and the holdfasts attached to the bottom of the window frames are also embedded in the RCC sill band (See figure below).
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify">Use a slotted block at corners and junctions to pass the vertical steel bar; the gap is then filled with cement concrete.</p>

                            <p><strong>Step 9: Masonry above Window Sill</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                ● Minimum 36 hours after the RCC Sill band has been laid and all window frames have been placed in position, masonry work above the sill level can begin.<br />
                                ● In Zone B, 200 mm thick solid concrete block walls in 1:6 cement sand mortar are a good option.<br />
                                ● Do not use blocks in load-bearing walls unless the compressive strength is at least 60kg/sq.cm.<br />
                                ● Continue masonry work above the plinth level, using slotted concrete blocks at corners.<br />
                                ● The central holdfast of the door frame is fixed into the RCC sill band.<br />
                                ● Fix the holdfasts attached to the vertical members of the door and window frames into the walls with cement concrete as the work continues.<br />
                                ● If door/window frames are fixed later, the holdfasts may get loose and will not strengthen the door/window openings in walls.
