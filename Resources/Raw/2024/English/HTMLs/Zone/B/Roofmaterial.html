                                There are two types of roofs that are common in Himachal Pradesh:
                                <br />i. Flat RCC roof
                                <br />ii. Sloping roofs made of stone patties, metal sheets, etc., supported over wooden or steel framework of trusses, rafters, purlins, etc.
                                <br />● The materials used in RCC roofing, like cement, sand, steel, and stone aggregate, have been described above.
                                <br />● For sloping roofs, the steel and wooden framework has also been discussed under their respective heads.

                                The final covering for sloping roofs includes metallic sheets such as CGI sheets, pre-coated steel sheets, aluminum corrugated sheets, fiberglass, and other polymeric sheets available in the market. Choose a type as per your requirement.
                                <br />Make sure to select the size of sheets that will fit your roof without too much cutting and jointing to avoid unnecessary cutting, overlapping, and wastage.
                                <br />Good quality, heavy-gauge sheets contribute to a longer life for your roof.

                                ● Provide proper overlaps at joints and fix the sheets using GI-J hooks, rubber washers, and cup washers of good quality.
                                <br />● In high wind areas, provide 40 to 50mm wide GI flats over the sheets with J hooks to avoid blowing away of sheets during high winds.
                                <br />● Secure all your trusses, rafters, purlins, etc., with the walls/RCC roof and Gable bands using steel cleats/bands.
