                            • Each layer should be compacted by using a ground tamper. Make sure that it does not damage the foundation.<br />
                            • Add layers sequentially on both sides of the foundation until the required height is reached, which is generally slightly more than the surrounding ground level.<br />

                            ● We will use a foundation which is 75 cm wide and 60 cm deep. If the ground has loose and weak soil, you may have to use a bigger foundation, consult the JE-in charge.<br />

                            ● Refill trenches with available excavated soil in layers and compact well.

                            ● Then we will lay a 10 to 15 cm thick layer of cement concrete 1:4:8 using 40mm down-size stone aggregate/gravel. At some undulations of the foundation trench, the thickness might be more to level the base. Never level the base by putting soil back in the trenches.<br />

                            ● On reaching a level 75mm below the plinth level, 75 mm thick RCC plinth band is provided on top of the masonry using steel bars and cement concrete 1:1.5:3. The vertical bars, at every corner, pass through the masonry and also through the RCC plinth band.<br />

                            ● Zone C is mostly in earthquake zone IV. We must therefore take necessary measures as detailed below very carefully. These measures actually bind all the walls of a house horizontally and vertically by RCC bands.<br />
                            ● Vertical 12mm diameter bars are provided in masonry walls at every corner and wall junction from foundation to the roof. All the walls are tied together by RCC bands horizontally at plinth level, window sill level, door lintel level, roof level, and at gable level without any break. Any building when tied together like this can resist fairly strong earthquakes at a small additional cost.<br />
                            RCC Earthquake Protection Bands:<br />
                            ● RCC earthquake bands consist of 2 nos. 12 mm diameter bars which are held together by 6mm diameter links at 200 mm apart. These bars are placed on masonry walls at plinth, window sill, lintel, roof, and gable level and are embedded in 1:1.5:3 cement concrete 75 mm thick.<br />
                            ● The steel bars in RCC bands do not terminate at corners, the bars are bent into the adjacent walls about 500 mm, as shown in the figures, at every corner and wall junction.<br />
                            ● The small dots at the corners are the vertical steel bars. See how the bars pass through the RCC bands at corners. Cast the RCC bands on all the walls at the same time in one go.<br />
                            ● The above details of placing steel bars are very important for safety against earthquakes. If bars terminate at corners they give no protection.
