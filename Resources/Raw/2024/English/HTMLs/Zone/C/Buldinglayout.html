                                ● Select a house plan according to your budget and family requirements.<br />
                                ● Check that it will fit well on your house site.<br />
                                ● We have selected a house plan, as an example, to proceed step by step. It is a small two-room house for a small family. The plinth area is about 27 sqm.<br />
                                ● Find out the cost of construction per sq.m of the plinth area in your locality. Multiply the cost/sq.m and the plinth area of the plan in sq.m to get an approximate cost of construction of your house in your locality.<br />
                                ● The location of windows may have to be readjusted as per your construction site to ensure proper sunlight and ventilation.<br />
                                ● This plan is suitable for PMAY-G Yojana beneficiaries too.
