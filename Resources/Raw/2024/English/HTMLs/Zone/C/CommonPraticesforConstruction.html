                                ● Draw a 4-meter line from point A to B where a 90-degree angle is required. Fix pegs at points A and B.<br />
                                ● The first person holds the initial end of the measuring tape at peg A at zero and at 12 meters.<br />
                                ● The other person holds the tape at the 4-meter mark and places a peg at point B.<br />
                                ● A third person holds the tape at the 9-meter mark, identifying point C, and then places a peg at C.<br />
                                ● Extend line AC to the required length.<br />
                                ● Clean the construction site and ensure it is flat.<br />
                                ● Place concrete block markers at all corners, about 1.5 meters away from the outer walls of the proposed building.<br />
                                ● Ensure blocks are of equal height to keep the thread off the ground.<br />
                                ● Mark the center line of the outer wall with a cotton thread and tape. Stretch the thread firmly so it does not sag.<br />
                                ● At the building corners, divide the line of cotton thread at right angles using the 3:4:5 method to obtain 90 degrees.

                                ● Use a 10-meter water tube filled with water.<br />
                                ● Hold both ends vertically to prevent water from draining, tapping the tube to remove any trapped air bubbles.<br />
                                ● Ensure that the water level is the same in both ends when held together.<br />
                                ● Identify the reference point A, the level to be transferred to another point B.<br />
                                ● Have an assistant hold the tube at reference level A.<br />
                                ● Place the other end of the tube near point B, adjusting it until the water level matches at A, then mark this level at B.<br />
                                ● Now points A and B are at the same level.
