                                There are two types of roofs that are common in Himachal Pradesh:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Flat RCC roof</li>
                                    <li>Sloping roofs made from stone patties, metal sheets, etc., supported over wooden or steel frameworks like trusses, rafters, and purlins.</li>
                                </ol>
                                ● The materials used in RCC roofing such as cement, sand, steel, and stone aggregate have been described above.<br />
                                ● For sloping roofs, the steel and wooden framework has also been discussed under respective headings.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify">
                                The final covering for sloping roofs typically consists of metallic sheets, such as CGI sheets, pre-coated steel sheets, aluminum corrugated sheets, fiberglass, or other polymeric sheets available in the market. Select a type as per your requirement.<br />
                                Make sure to select the size of sheets that will fit your roof without too much cutting or jointing to avoid unnecessary cutting, overlapping, and wastage.<br />
                                Good quality, heavy gauge sheets contribute to the long life of your roof.

                                ● Provide proper overlaps at joints and fix the sheets using GI J-hooks, rubber washers, and cup washers of good quality.<br />
                                ● In high wind areas, provide 40 to 50mm wide GI flats over the sheets with J-hooks to avoid blowing away of sheets during high winds.<br />
                                ● Secure all your trusses, rafters, purlins, etc., with the walls/RCC roof and Gable bands using steel cleats or bands.
