                                1. <strong>Install Formwork:</strong> Construct formwork along the edges of the plinth masonry using timber, plywood, or metal sheets to define the plinth band's shape. Ensure to secure shuttering and alignment.<br />
                                2. <strong>Place Reinforcement Bars:</strong> Provide horizontal bars for the RCC band/Bond Beam as per drawing (next page). Allow vertical seismic bars at the corners to pass through the horizontal bars.<br />
                                3. <strong>Pour Concrete:</strong> Fill the formwork with M20 concrete mix, compacting it thoroughly to remove air voids.<br />
                                4. <strong>Cure and Finish:</strong> Let the concrete cure for approximately 28 days. Keep it moist during curing to prevent cracking. Remove the formwork carefully and finish the surface as desired.

                                • A 75 mm thick RCC plinth band is provided continuously over all the walls to bind them together at the plinth level. This provides safety against earthquakes and non-uniform settlement of the foundation.<br />
                                • The plinth bands/beams are reinforced with at least two 12mm diameter steel bars that bend at wall corners to enter the adjoining walls. The steel bars should not terminate at corners or T-junctions of walls.

                                Tips to remember:<br />
                                1. <strong>Foundation and Soil:</strong> Ensure ground is leveled, soil compacted, and drainage is provided to prevent settling and water accumulation.<br />
                                2. <strong>Material Quality:</strong> Use high-quality concrete (M20+), bricks, or stones, and reinforce with steel for strength and durability.<br />
                                3. <strong>Dimensions and Alignment:</strong> Follow specifications for uniform height and width, ensuring accurate measurements and level alignment to avoid structural issues.
