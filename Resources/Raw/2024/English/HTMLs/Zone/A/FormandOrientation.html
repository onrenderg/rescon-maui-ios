                            <p align="justify">While planning the layout for your house, there are a few guidelines that should be kept in mind:</p>

                            <img src="img/Figure5.1.1.JPG" alt="Simple building shape" class="full-width-image" />
                            <p align="justify">Simple shapes perform the best during earthquakes. Make sure that your building has as simple a form as possible. The building shape should be regular. If unavoidable, provide separation gaps to form regular shapes.</p>

                            <img src="img/Figure5.1.2.JPG" alt="Building orientation" class="full-width-image" />
                            <p align="justify">It is preferable to orient a building in a north-south orientation. The longer side should be on the North-South axis.</p>

                            <p align="justify">
                                • A building should not be too long compared to its width. (The ratio of length to width should not be more than 2:1, or according to local area norms).<br />
                                • It is better to construct a large building in smaller sections by providing gaps between different sections.<br />
                                • A symmetrically designed building, both horizontally and vertically, performs better during an earthquake.
