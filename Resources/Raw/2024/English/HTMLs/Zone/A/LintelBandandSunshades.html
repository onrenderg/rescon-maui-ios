                                75 mm thick RCC Bands are provided at plinth, window sill, door lintel, and roof levels. In gable walls, RCC Gable bands are also provided.<br />
                                • These are important structural elements that bind all the walls horizontally at respective levels and protect them during earthquakes.<br />
                                • These bands also act as door and window lintels. Sunshade projections can be taken out from these RCC bands over door and window openings.<br />
                                • Vertical steel bars at corners pass through these bands to bind the foundations, walls, and the roof vertically.<br />
                                • No bars of RCC bands terminate at corners. (Fig.6.2.13.) The bars bend around the corners and go at least 0.5m into the adjacent walls.

                                1. Structural Support: Distributes load above openings evenly, preventing cracks and ensuring building stability.<br />
                                2. Earthquake Resistance: Enhances building rigidity, reducing collapse risk in earthquakes.<br />
                                3. Load Distribution: Distributes load away from openings, preventing localized stress and damage.

                                ● When the vertical bars need to be extended, a new bar can be tied to it from within the RCC band only as shown.<br />
                                ● The new bar is bent about 500 mm into the band and tied to the old bar. The band is now filled with concrete as shown.

                                ● We will provide an RCC roof band binding all the walls just as we had provided RCC bands earlier.<br />
                                ● In the case of a single-storey building, 12 mm diameter corner steel bars projecting out are bent into the Roof Band or into the steel bars of the RCC/RBC roof slab. Else, the bars shall go through the corners in the upper floor.

                            <p><strong>Step 9: Laying the Roof</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                In Zone A, people prefer a flat roof. The top is covered with thick mud. It is warm in winters, but it needs frequent repairs and maintenance. You can lay RCC/RBC roof and provide thick mud layer over it for heat insulation.<br />
                                We will now make a durable Reinforced Brick Concrete Roof (RBC) using conventional mud bricks as follows:<br />
                                ● First of all, we shall provide shuttering in each room, kitchen, toilet veranda, etc., using steel plates/wooden planks supported over vertical supports of Ballies or other struts in level with the RCC roof band.<br />
                                ● Now we will place mud bricks (300x150x150 mm) size on the shuttering keeping a gap of about 60 mm around it.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify">
                                ● Two days after the Bond Beams at the plinth level have been cast, we can start masonry in the superstructure.<br />
                                ● In the very cold climate of zone A, we require thick walls having good insulation properties. At least 300 mm thick Rammed earth walls or sundried mud block walls are common in this zone. Since the region is basically dry, earth walls perform well with regular repairs and maintenance.<br />
                                ● The earth walls have lower strength than burnt red clay brick walls, so special precautions have to be taken for durability, strength, and to lower maintenance costs of these walls.<br />
                                ● We shall make a house by a technique called Confined Masonry, using sun-dried mud blocks confined within RCC confining frames for highly improved performance during earthquakes. The external wall surfaces shall be plastered by ‘Ferro Cement Plaster’ to lower maintenance costs considerably.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Step 9: Masonry Work in Superstructure</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Now let us go back to our House Plan:</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                ● We have completed the initial construction of our foundations using coursed Rubble Masonry in cement mortar and have also cast our RCC Plinth Bond Beam.<br />
                                ● We will first place door frames on the RCC plinth/Bond beam and ensure that the holdfasts are embedded in the masonry using cement concrete as the masonry goes on.<br />
                                ● Above the plinth level bond beam, we will commence masonry using sundried bricks measuring 30 x 15 x 15 cm.<br />
                                ● We will use cement bricks at both ends of our brick wall courses that go into the RCC tie columns and the rest will be in mud bricks.<br />
                                ● The cement bricks make toothing in the masonry that will go into the RCC Tie columns.<br />
                                ● Now fill the gaps in masonry with concrete to cast RCC tie columns. The brick toothing will make a good bond between masonry and RCC tie columns.<br />
                                ● Continue brick masonry nearly up to the window sill level. Provide 75 mm thick RCC Sill band to bind all the walls and tie columns together.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify">
                                RCC Sill Band: Install 2 nos of 12 mm diameter horizontal bars on walls at sill and lintel level, passing through tie columns. These horizontal bars are linked with 6/8 mm diameter connectors at 20 cm spacing, as illustrated. At corners and wall junctions, the bars are bent about 50 cm into adjacent walls as shown in the figure; this is very important. The bands are concreted in 75mm thickness, along with the tie columns at sill and lintel levels.<br />
                                ● At window sill level and at door lintel level, 75 to 100 mm thick RCC Sill Band and RCC Lintel bands are provided.<br />
                                ● The Sill band and the lintel bands have 2 nos of 12mm diameter bars bound by 6mm diameter links at 20 cm c/c, running all around the house over all the walls.<br />
                                ● The bars of the RCC bands and RCC Bond Beams bend about 40 cm into the reinforcement of the tie columns as shown or bend into the adjacent walls at least 50 cm. The bars should not terminate at corners. See figure.<br />
                                ● The RCC bands and bond beams are laid on all the walls without break.<br />
                                ● The middle holdfast of door frames are embedded into the RCC sill band for continuity.<br />
                                ● The concrete used is M20 grade, or 1 cement + 1.5 sand + 3 parts stone aggregate 10-12mm size.<br />
                                ● Use a vibrator to compact the concrete. Fig 6.3.1.16. Example of Confined masonry Fig 6.3.1.15. Reinforcement for the building (Blown-up detail) By utilizing tie columns, bond beams, RCC lintel bands, and RCC sill bands, a house is reinforced and bound together in all directions to enhance its resilience against earthquakes, winds, and other ground movements.

                                ● Each window frame features two holdfasts welded or fixed to the bottom rail, which will be grouted into the RCC sill band. Likewise, the middle holdfasts of the door frames are also embedded in the RCC sill band.<br />
                                ● Cement concrete mix of 1 part cement, 1.5 parts sand, and 3 parts stone aggregate (10-12mm size) is utilized.

                            <p><strong>Work above the Sill level:</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                ● Two to three days after casting the RCC sill band, we can start masonry above it.<br />
                                ● Continue water curing of the cement-based work already done.<br />
                                ● When the masonry reaches the Lintel band level, provide 2 nos. 12mm diameter bars with links exactly the way we provided in the sill band.<br />
                                ● At this level, we will provide shuttering and steel bars for the landing of stairs, lofts, and sunshades, etc.<br />
                                ● Extend the reinforcing bars of tie columns if needed.<br />
                                ● Provide shuttering on two sides of the Tie columns and RCC lintel band.<br />
                                ● Fill cement concrete in the Tie columns, lintel band, sunshades, landing, etc., in one go using a vibrator.
