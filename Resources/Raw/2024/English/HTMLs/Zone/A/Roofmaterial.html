                                There are two types of roofs that are common in Himachal Pradesh: i. Flat RCC roof and ii. Sloping roofs of stone patties, metal sheets, etc., supported over wooden or steel framework of trusses, rafters, purlins, etc.<br />
                                ● The materials used in RCC roofing like cement, sand, steel, and stone aggregate have been described above.<br />
                                ● For sloping roofs, the steel and wooden framework has also been discussed under their respective heads.

                            <p align="justify">
                                The final covering, in case of sloping roofs, are metallic sheets like CGI sheets, pre-coated steel sheets, Aluminium corrugated sheets, various fiberglass and other polymeric sheets that are available in the market. Select a type as per your requirement.<br />
                                Make sure to select the size of sheets that will fit your roof without too much cutting and jointing to avoid unnecessary cutting, overlapping, and wastage. Good quality, heavy gauge sheets contribute to the long life of your roof.

                                ● Provide proper overlaps at joints and fix the sheets using GI- J hooks, rubber washers, and cup washers of good quality.<br />
                                ● In high wind areas, provide 40 to 50mm wide GI flats over the sheets with J hooks to avoid blowing away of sheets during high winds.<br />
                                ● Secure all your trusses, rafters, purlins, etc., with the walls/RCC roof and Gable bands using steel cleats/bands.
