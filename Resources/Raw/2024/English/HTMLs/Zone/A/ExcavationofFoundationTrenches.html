                                1. Mark the foundation trench width by placing pegs at both sides of the centerline, marked during layout, equal to the foundation width required.<br />
                                2. Determine safe vertical sides of the trench wall, by examining the soil quality.<br />
                                3. Remove the soil’s top surface and remove waste, organic materials, and other trash.<br />
                                4. Ensure the flatness of the pit surface using a water tube level or with a scale and spirit level.

                                        • Lay about 12 cm thick 1:5:10 cement concrete in the foundation trench and compact well to obtain a level surface.<br />
                                        • Provide 1 no 12mm dia vertical steel bar at every corner from the bottom of the foundation masonry.<br />
                                        • Construct foundation using bricks/blocks/coursed rubble masonry in cement mortar nearly up to the plinth level.<br />
                                        • Fill the space around the foundation masonry with 100 mm thick layers of soil.<br />
                                        • If the soil is dry, moisten it by spraying water.<br />
                                        • Each layer should be compacted using a ground tamper to prevent damage to the foundation.<br />
                                        • Add layers sequentially on both sides of the foundation until the required height is reached, which is generally slightly above the surrounding ground level.<br />
                                        • Extra excavated soil can be used to fill the plinth.

                                    • The foundation should be at least 600 mm deep and 750 mm wide for a two-storey house. If the soil is loose or water stagnates for more than 2 days, consult with a Junior Engineer (JE) for a deeper foundation.<br />
                                    • This sketch shows stone masonry in the foundation.<br />
                                    • Dig the foundation trenches and compact the base with a rammer.<br />
                                    • Lay a 150mm thick base concrete (1:5:10) and ram it well to get a level surface.<br />
                                    • Provide one 12mm diameter vertical TMT bar at every corner and T-junction of walls passing through the base concrete and masonry, encased in 1:1.5:3 cement concrete as shown in the figure.
                                </p>

                                    • If a large rock or boulder is found in the soil, do not remove it. Rough cut the top and sides to get a stepped shape and construct the foundation masonry around the rock using cement mortar.<br />
                                    • Provide one 12mm diameter vertical steel bar at every corner and wall junction, and encase the steel bar with cement concrete (1:1.5:3). If concrete blocks are available, use them in cement mortar (1:5) for the foundation.<br />
                                    • Provide 'through stones' in coursed rubble masonry at every 1200mm length of wall. Through stones are large stones that span the width of the wall.<br />
                                    • Continue masonry up to the plinth level, at least 30 cm above the ground level.

                                <p><strong>Step 3: Providing Vertical Steel Reinforcement at Corners</strong></p>
                                <p align="justify">
                                    • Ensure that vertical steel bars are provided at every corner and extend at least 1200 mm above the plinth.<br />
                                    • Continue masonry work for the foundation and plinth.<br />
                                    • Provide through stones at about 1200 mm intervals in every alternate course.<br />
                                    • If long stones are not available, leave a gap of about 15 cm (6") in masonry, half fill the gap with 1:1.5:3 cement concrete, place a 10 mm diameter steel bar, and fill with concrete. This creates a good through stone in the masonry.<br />
                                    • Continue masonry up to 75mm below the plinth level, then provide a 75mm thick RCC plinth band to tie all the walls at the plinth level.
                                </p>
