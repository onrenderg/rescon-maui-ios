                            <p align="justify">
                                1. <strong>Install Formwork:</strong> Set up formwork along the edges of the plinth masonry using timber, plywood, or metal sheets to shape the plinth band. Secure the alignment.<br />
                                2. <strong>Place Reinforcement Bars:</strong> Place horizontal reinforcement bars according to the design, allowing vertical seismic bars at corners to pass through the horizontal bars.<br />
                                3. <strong>Pour Concrete:</strong> Use an M20 concrete mix to fill the formwork, compacting it thoroughly to remove air voids.<br />
                                4. <strong>Cure and Finish:</strong> Allow the concrete to cure for 28 days, keeping it moist to prevent cracking. After curing, remove the formwork and finish the surface as needed.

                                ● A continuous 75 mm thick RCC plinth band is provided over all walls at plinth level to improve earthquake resistance and prevent non-uniform foundation settlement.<br />
                                ● Reinforce plinth bands with at least two 12mm diameter steel bars that bend at wall corners to extend into adjoining walls. Do not terminate steel bars at wall corners or T-junctions.

                                <strong>Tips to Remember:</strong><br />
                                1. <strong>Foundation and Soil:</strong> Level the ground, compact the soil, and ensure drainage to prevent settlement and water accumulation.<br />
                                2. <strong>Material Quality:</strong> Use high-quality concrete (M20+), bricks, or stones, with steel reinforcement for durability.<br />
                                3. <strong>Dimensions and Alignment:</strong> Follow specifications for uniformity, and ensure accurate measurements and level alignment.

                            <p><strong>Step 4: Construction of Earthquake Band</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                ● Do not terminate RCC band bars at corners; instead, bend them 60 cm into adjacent walls.<br />
                                ● Use 12mm main bars, 6mm links, and 12mm vertical bars at each corner and T-junction from foundation to roof.<br />
                                ● Construct RCC bands at 75mm thickness with a mix of 1 part cement, 1.5 parts sand, and 3 parts 10mm aggregate.<br />
                                ● Place the earthquake band continuously across all walls at plinth level.<br />
                                ● Allow at least 36 hours of curing before beginning masonry on the plinth band.<br />
                                ● Additional RCC bands should be constructed at sill, lintel, roof, and gable levels.

                            <p><strong>Step 5: Process to Be Adopted</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                ● After casting the RCC Plinth Band, begin masonry in the superstructure a day later.<br />
                                ● In cold climates, use thick walls for insulation (e.g., 300 mm thick rammed earth walls or sun-dried mud block walls).<br />
                                ● To improve strength and durability, construct the house with sun-dried mud blocks confined within RCC bands and reinforced with steel bars at corners.<br />
                                ● Plaster external wall surfaces with Ferrocement to reduce maintenance.<br />
                                ● Painted Ferrocement plaster offers durability similar to traditional cement plastered surfaces.
