                                Ground Floor Roof:<br />
                                ● For the Ground floor/intermediate roof we can select a RCC slab roof (A) or Wooden planks supported on wooden/hollow steel beams (B) resting on walls.<br />
                                ● You have walls over which RCC Bond Beams have been laid and vertical steel bars of the tie columns are projecting at every corner.<br />
                                ● We can make a 12 cm thick RCC slab for the whole house.<br />
                                ● First provide good level shuttering between the walls.<br />
                                ● After providing shuttering, we will provide 12 mm diameter main steel bars (Red) over the shorter spans as shown, at a spacing of 12cm center to center (c/c). Now, on the 12 mm diameter bars provided 10mm diameter distribution bars (Blue) at 20cm c/c. The bars are kept about 15 to 20 mm above the shuttering by putting spacers or pieces of stones etc., so that concrete can go below the bars and cover them properly. But the bars should not be more than 20 mm above the shuttering as this will drastically reduce strength. Tie the bars by MS wire to keep them in place. Check the directions of red and blue bars and follow carefully.<br />
                                ● The concrete shall be 1 part cement + 1.5 part clean coarse sand and 3 parts 10 to 15mm size stone aggregate (bajari).<br />
                                ● Never add extra sand or extra water to concrete, it reduces strength.<br />
                                ● Place concrete in slab within half an hour of adding water to the mix.<br />
                                ● Use a plate vibrator to compact concrete well on the slab. A compact concrete gives a durable slab which does not leak and lasts longer.<br />
                                ● Keep the slab wet by frequent water curing or ponding on the slab.<br />
                                ● Remove shuttering after a minimum of 28 days depending on temperature.

                            <p><strong>Laying Reinforced Brick Concrete (RBC) Slab Roof</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                ● Provide good strong and level shuttering between the walls, supported rigidly over ballies/steel props.<br />
                                ● Lay bricks on the shuttering, ensure that longer side of the brick is parallel to the shorter side of the room. Maintain gaps of 50 to 70 mm width, (otherwise it will be difficult to fill concrete properly). Place 12mm diameter main bars (Red) first and place 12mm diameter distributer bars (Blue) crossing over the main (red) bars. (Fig. 6.2.1.37). Provide spacers below the bars to ensure that the bars are about 15 to 20mm above the shuttering.<br />
                                ● Fill the gaps between the bricks with 1:1.5:3 cement concrete. Use a vibrator for compaction of concrete and to encase the bars in the gaps with concrete properly.<br />
                                ● After filling all the gaps properly, provide a 6 cm thick layer of cement concrete over the laid bricks covering the entire surface immediately after filling the gaps.<br />
                                ● Level and finish the surface to proper slope towards the rainwater pipe/drain.<br />
                                ● Continue water curing for at least 21 days.<br />
                                ● Depending on local temperature, the shuttering can be knocked down after at least 28 days. If it is very cold, we may have to wait a few days more.
