                                ● Draw a 4 m line from A to B where a 90-degree angle is required. Fix pegs at points A and B.<br />
                                ● The first person holds the initial end of the measuring tape at peg A (zero mark) and also at the 12 m mark.<br />
                                ● The second person holds the tape at the 4 m mark and fixes a peg at B, marking it at 4 m.<br />
                                ● A third person holds the tape at the 9 m mark and places a peg at point C.<br />
                                ● Extend line AC to the required length as needed.<br />
                                ● Clear the construction site and ensure that it is flat.<br />
                                ● Place concrete block markers at all corners, approximately 1.5 m away from the outer walls of the proposed building.<br />
                                ● Ensure blocks are of equal height to keep the thread off the ground.<br />
                                ● Mark the center line of the outer wall with cotton thread and tape. Stretch the thread firmly to prevent sagging.<br />
                                ● At the building corners, align the thread at right angles using the 3:4:5 method to achieve a 90-degree angle.

                            <p><strong>Water Level for Site Leveling</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                ● Use a water tube approximately 10 m in length, filling it with water.<br />
                                ● Hold both ends vertically to prevent water from draining. Tap the tube to eliminate any trapped air bubbles.<br />
                                ● Check that the water level in both ends of the tube is equal.<br />
                                ● Identify the reference point A, which is the level you wish to transfer to point B.<br />
                                ● Have an assistant stand at reference level A, marking it.<br />
                                ● Move the other end of the tube to point B, adjusting it up and down until the water level matches A's mark.<br />
                                ● Once level, mark point B. Now points A and B are at the same level.
