                                As a general rule, hill slopes that are made of soft
                                soils and have slopes steeper than 30º are vulnerable
                                to landslides. The problem is aggravated in soft
                                saturated soils even with slopes less than 30º.

                                be at least 3 times the difference in their founding

                                failures. Building structures on such
                                unstable ground can lead to
                                structural damage or collapse.

                                Water runoff is more rapid on
