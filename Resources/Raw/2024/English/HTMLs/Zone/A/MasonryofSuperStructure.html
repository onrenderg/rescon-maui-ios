                                    The thickness of the walls depend upon the design. Where bricks are costly but stone is available precast stone
                                    concrete blocks, hollow blocks, hammer dressed stones etc. are used as masonry units. Walls must be strong
                                    enough to bear the loads, check moisture and resist fire and other natural vagaries. The masonry units must be
                                    joined using cement mortar. All walls must be designed to take extra loads coming due to natural hazards like
                                    earthquakes/ cyclones/ floods/ fires etc.
                                </strong>

                                1. At site, store bricks in stacks. On the day before using the bricks in masonry, spray a lot of water on the stacks
                                to drench the stack well up to the core.<br />
                                2. Again spray water before taking the bricks out from the stack for use in masonry. Dry bricks give poor quality
                                and low strength masonry.<br />
                                3. The bricks are generally laid in a pattern called English Bond. Wall thickness is equal to one length of the brick
                                which depends upon the type of brick being used.

                                ● Once we have reached the plinth level and cast the RCC plinth
                                band to bind all the walls together and placed all the door
                                frames in position, it is time to start masonry in superstructure.<br />
                                ● Above the plinth level, we shall use mud blocks (size:
                                300x150x150 mm) produced locally in the region, for making
                                walls.<br />
                                ● We will make the walls in a manner so that these walls can
                                sustain fairly high earthquake forces and have much better
                                looks and durability.<br />
                                ● We shall use locally available sun dried mud blocks
                                (300x150x150 mm size) to make 300 mm thick walls in 1:6

                                ● For safety against earthquakes, winds etc we will tie all the
                                walls together by RCC bands and vertically we will tie the
                                foundation, walls and the roof by vertical steel bars provided in
                                every corner. This is very important in the districts of Lahaul & Spiti and Kinnaur.<br />
                                ● Now that we have provided RCC plinth band on all the walls without any break, we can start masonry in
                                superstructure.<br />
                                ● Look at the figures and follow the instructions below carefully on how to pass the steel bar through the corners and wall

                                • Ferro-cement Plaster is applied on surfaces to which normal cement plaster does not stick or where the plaster may develop shrinkage cracks.<br />
                                • Ferro-cement Plaster is more impervious to seepage of water.<br />
                                • Ferro-cement develops a good bond with the surface and is more resistant to impacts.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Application of Ferro-Cement Plaster on Mud Walls/Roof:</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                • First repair any cracks etc. in the surface to which ferro-cement
                                plaster is to be applied.<br />
                                • You need not repair minor undulations, these will be covered
                                by the FC plaster.<br />
                                • Clean the surface thoroughly of any fungus, loose dirt sticking
                                poster papers etc.<br />
                                • Now take 20x20mm square mesh of (22 SWG or thicker GI
                                wire) and wrap around all the walls starting from a corner (A).<br />
                                • Fix the mesh/Jaali to the walls using GI wire U-nails (min 40mm
                                long).<br />
                                • Fix nails at about 300 to 400mm (12 to 18 inches) intervals into
                                the mud surface.<br />
                                • Overlap all wire-mesh joints (vertical and horizontal) at least
                                100mm.<br />
                                • Apply 15mm thick cement sand plaster to the whole surface
                                properly covering the mesh and the U-nails. See that nails/wire
                                mesh are not projecting out of the plaster.<br />
                                • Finish the surface smooth by steel trowel.<br />
                                • Water cure the surface for at least 20 days.

                                • Apply cement mortar on the wire mesh, then coat the plaster

                                • Apply the final smooth coat of 1:3 cement plaster.<br />
