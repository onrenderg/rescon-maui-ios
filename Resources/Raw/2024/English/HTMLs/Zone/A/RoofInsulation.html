                                ● Initially, 12mm diameter main bars (highlighted in
                                red) are positioned within the gaps, followed by
                                the placement of 10mm diameter distributor bars
                                (highlighted in blue) over the main bars.
                                Subsequently, the gaps are filled with concrete,
                                and a 6cm layer of concrete is applied across the
                                entire slab. The concrete surface is then leveled,
                                and a slope is established to facilitate water
                                drainage towards the outlet.<br />
                                ● Water curing should be continued for a minimum
                                of 21 days. The shuttering can be removed after 28
                                days.<br />
                                ● As depicted below, shuttering and centering are
                                erected between the walls.<br />
                                ● Construction of the parapet wall and the Mumty
                                can commence three days after casting the slab.<br />
                                ● The parapet wall should be constructed to a height
                                of 90 cm using brick masonry, ensuring that the tie
                                columns pass through it. These tie columns should
                                be filled.<br />
                                ● At the uppermost part of the parapet, the tie
                                columns are secured together using 2 nos of 8 mm
                                diameter steel bars with 6 mm diameter links, akin
                                to the process used for creating RCC bands.
                                Concrete is then filled, and a half-round coping is
                                fashioned at the top of the parapet wall.

                                ● Do not lay roof slab and/or cast any other cement
                                concrete component in frigid temperature. Cement
                                concrete is badly affected if freshly laid cement concrete
                                freezes due to very low (Below 5°C) temperatures.<br />
                                ● Use high-quality mud blocks, which should be well-cured
                                and have the proper mix of soil and stabilizer.<br />
                                ● Mud blocks provide natural thermal insulation. Consider
                                adding an additional layer of insulation if needed.<br />
                                ● Apply a waterproofing layer on top of the roof to prevent
                                water infiltration, which can damage both the concrete
                                and mud blocks.<br />

                                ● When the construction of the mumty has
                                completed, we will provide a heat insulation layer
                                over the roof.<br />
                                ● Spread a 20mm thick layer of mud mortar on the
                                roof slab.<br />
                                ● Place the mud bricks over the slab in proper and
                                keeping a gap of 20mm between the bricks on all
                                sides.<br />
                                ● Fill the gaps with mud mortar or cement mortar
                                (1:5) thoroughly.<br />
                                ● After 3 days of drying spread 12x12mm square
                                wire mesh on the whole roof and 15cm along the
                                peripheral walls.<br />
                                ● Fix the mesh to the bricks below and to side walls
                                using 50mm long U-nails at about 30 to 40 cm
                                apart.<br />
                                ● Cover the mesh with a 20mm layer of 1:3 cement
                                sand mortar and finish smooth. Water cure for 30
                                days.<br />
                                ● You now have a durable and well insulated roof
                                finish.<br />
                                ● Provide rainwater pipe /spout for drainage of
                                rainwater if required.
